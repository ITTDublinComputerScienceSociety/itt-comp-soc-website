# Goal

The goal of this website is to showcase the Computer Society and its members, maybe make it a hub to centralise all the official/unofficial infos and events. We could also use it as a way to easily get in contact with other members, request events or else.

Any suggestions are welcome !

# TODO

* Define the use cases and definite goals of the website
* Select appropriate technologies/frameworks
* Code away !
